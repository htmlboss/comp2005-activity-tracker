	This assignment instructs us to ``prioritize features of the system you are supposed to implement.'' As the application being developed is an activity logger app, we believe two of the most crucial parts of the app --- its essence --- are the user interface and the backend data storage and retrieval. Because of this, in this assignment to ``create architecturally significant design,'' we have focused on developing the Java-based UI and engineering an efficient database structure for the backend that will enable easy retrieval of large data sets for a particular user. 
	
	We have decided to use a relational database and are using SQLite to implement this. SQLite was chosen for developmental simplicity and availability of a JDBC-SQLite driver.
