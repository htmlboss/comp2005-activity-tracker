# COMP-2005 Activity Logger

### Description 
We have been contracted to design an Activity Tracker application that lets users measure and track runs. Users of the application will be able to import their activities from smart watches/devices (emulated by importing from a file for the project). The Activity Tracker will provide the user with diverse statistics (e.g. calories used, average speed, cumulative distance).
