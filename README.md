# Comp 2005 Activity Tracker

### Description 
  We have been contracted to design an Activity Tracker application that lets users measure and track their runs, walks, and other exercises (e.g. aerobics, cross-country skiing, hiking, biking). Users of the application will be able to import their activities from smart watches/devices (e.g. Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin). The Activity Tracker application will provide the user with diverse statistics (e.g. calories used, heart rate, average speed, pace, dehydration, cumulative distance). The user (with permission) will be able to see activities of their friends.
